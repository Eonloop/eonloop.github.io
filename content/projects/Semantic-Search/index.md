### Purpose Of This Project
This project spawned from my professional experience in documentation, many times finding the most relevant information out of our documentation stores, and a lot of the time they don't even know what's in their own documentation either.

With my interest in Linear Algebra and Natural Language Processing as well as DevOps I figured that a solid project to work on would be to implement a full DevOps pipeline for a dockerized Semantic Search application.

### Tooling Utilized
- FastAPI
- Python
